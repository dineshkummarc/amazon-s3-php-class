Donovan Schönknecht's excellent S3 class, with one minor change to enable
short expire-time URLs. Because Amazon's servers can vary timestamps by as 
much as 90 seconds, using a short expiration can cause issues. This change
checks for a short expiration (180s or less) and if found polls S3, 
returning a timestamp to compare against. 

The intent is for quick authorization, unlock, and redirect.
